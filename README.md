About

This is a project in which we were assigned to do some unique task by combining two different products. COORS BEER and KLEENEX WET WIPES are the products we selected. Here, the scenario is to create beer brand but we have to use all the styling elements of Coors Beer such as label styling, font-styles, colour swatches, typography etc. and replace the content of the Coors Beer with the information of Kleenex Wetwipes.

Final step is to represent our brand worldwide and because of that, we have created a website for this brand which will give more information about the company, trendy and most liked beers, process- how beer is made?, and place where use can contact us to solve their inquires or doubts.

We have to make project responsive this time as well as to create three POPOVER using javascript which is somehow new and challenging to us.
